## Intro
- India offers "freedom of religion" (Matters of religion in the constitution).

## Affidavit of religion and/or name change
- Each converting person may declare conversion to Hinduism, together with name-change via an affidavit.
    - Draft affidavit may be found [here](../conversion_name_change_affidavit.pdf). It should be executed on appropriate stamp paper (Rs 20 or higher in Karnataka) and notarized.
- This will need to be advertised as a public notice in a major newspaper in case of name-change.
