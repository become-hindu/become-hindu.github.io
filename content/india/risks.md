## Inheritence issues
- In case of reconversion - one will be entitled to all benefits of Hindu law.
  - +++(PS: People who have converted out of Hinduism to Christianity or Islam have no right to ancestral property - they just have a share in parents' property.)+++ 
- In case persons from whom you inherit property are Christians - either Indian succession act or Hindu succession act applies depending on the religion of the deceased person. Either case, no problem. Of course, a parent can make a will to specifically exclude certain people from inheritence.
- In case of conversion from Islam to Hinduism - the convert looses all entitlement to family property. +++(Just stand on your own feet and be self-sufficient!)+++
